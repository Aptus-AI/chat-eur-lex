# Chat-EUR-Lex

This is the official repository of the Chat-EUR-Lex project funded by [NGI Search](https://ngi-search-2nd-open-call.fundingbox.com/). The project aim is to improve the accessibility of EU laws, thus democratizing the availability of legal information for companies, lawyers, researchers and citizens. Navigating the complex legal terrain of [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html) is a complicated challenge for citizens and companies, as the existing system requires a deep knowledge of legal jargon and categorizations. In this context, EUR-Lex is often difficult to use by non-experts.

Chat-EUR-Lex will be an AI-powered interface providing simplified explanations and ultimately fostering users' understanding of EU law. This information will be made available through an intuitive and easy-to-use conversational interface. This is how Chat-EUR-Lex will directly contribute to the realization of the EU's vision of promoting digital transformation, transparency and inclusion. 

The technologies underlying Chat-EUR-Lex are state-of-the-art AI techniques, such as Chat-Based Large Language Models (Chat LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
The project is funded within the framework of the NGI Search project under grant agreement No 101069364 (NGI Search 2nd open call 2023).
Duration: from September 2023 to September 2024.
Chat-EUR-Lex project is realized by the Institute of Legal Informatics and Judicial Systems (IGSG-CNR) and the Aptus.AI startup.


## Roadmap

- [ ] **Requirements and use cases definition**. In this initial phase, the project team identifies the specific requirements for the Chat-EUR-Lex system. This includes understanding the target audience's needs, such as citizens, lawyers, researchers, and companies. The team also defines the use cases, outlining how the AI-powered interface will assist users in navigating and understanding EU laws. \[In progress\]
- [ ] **UX Research and Wireframing**. User experience (UX) research involves studying how users interact with the current EUR-Lex system and identifying pain points and challenges. Based on this research, the team creates wireframes or prototypes of the Chat-EUR-Lex interface, mapping out the layout and design elements to ensure a user-friendly experience.
- [ ] **UX Validation**. The wireframes and prototypes are tested with potential users to gather feedback and validate the user experience. This step helps ensure that the interface meets users' needs and expectations.
- [ ] **Data collection and processing**. To power the AI system, a substantial amount of legal data from EUR-Lex is collected and processed (Italian and English languages). \[In progress\]
- [ ] **Semantic search engine setup**. Setting up a semantic search engine is a critical step. Semantic search allows users to find relevant legal information even if they don't use precise legal terminology. This involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve search accuracy. \[In progress\]
- [ ] **Semantic search engine tuning and validation**. The search engine is fine-tuned and validated to ensure that it effectively retrieves relevant legal documents and explanations. This tuning process may involve iterative adjustments based on experts' feedback and testing.
- [ ] **RAG-based Chat system development**. The project team develops the core AI chat system using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG combines retrieval-based methods with generative language models to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- [ ] **Chat models comparison and validation**. Multiple chat models may be compared to select the most effective one. The models are validated by assessing their ability to provide accurate and understandable explanations of EU law.
- [ ] **UI Development**. While the chat system is being developed, the user interface (UI) is designed and implemented. The UI should be intuitive and easy to use, providing access to the AI-powered chat system.
- [ ] **First version release**. The initial version of Chat-EUR-Lex is released to the public or a selected group of users. This version should provide basic functionality and serve as a starting point for further improvements.
- [ ] **Feedback collection and tuning**. After the first release, user feedback is actively collected and analyzed. This feedback is used to identify areas for improvement and fine-tune both the chat system and the user interface. This iterative process continues to enhance the system's effectiveness and user satisfaction.
