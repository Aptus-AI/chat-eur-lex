# Chat-EUR-Lex

This is the official repository of the Chat-EUR-Lex project funded by [NGI Search](https://ngi-search-2nd-open-call.fundingbox.com/). The project aim is to improve the accessibility of EU laws, thus democratizing the availability of legal information for companies, lawyers, researchers and citizens. Navigating the complex legal terrain of EUR-Lex is a complicated challenge for citizens and companies, as the existing system requires a deep knowledge of legal jargon and categorizations. In this context, EUR-Lex is often impenetrable to non-experts. 

Chat-EUR-Lex will be an AI-powered interface providing simplified explanations and ultimately fostering citizens' and companiesâ€™ understanding of EU law. This information will be made available through an intuitive and easy-to-use conversational interface. This is how Chat-EUR-Lex will directly contribute to the realization of the EU's vision of promoting digital transformation, transparency and inclusion. 

The technologies underlying Chat-EUR-Lex are state-of-the-art AI techniques, such as Chat-Based Large Language Models (Chat LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
